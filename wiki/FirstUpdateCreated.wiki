We finally have some stuff up for this gamemode.
This started last month, and it is finally complete.
Half of the HUD/GUI, 3 weapons, half of one of our maps.
Along with the code for inventory (hud/gui not done), code for picking up items (hud/gui/button not done), and finally the spawn shop is almost done (gui/hud and map area).

Complete parts of map:
The Safe Haven (Run by Quarantine)
Forest (Owned by Server;Empty Void)
The Neighborhood (Owned by Server;Empty Void)

Thats all we have completed. (Melee Weapons are in next updates)
Animations are next aswell, and the rest of the map is next.
